Senior Software Engineer (Hybrid)\n\nHomeward is rearchitecting the delivery of health and care in partnership with communities everywhere, starting in rural America. Today, 60 million Americans living in rural communities are facing a crisis of access to care. In the U.S. healthcare system, rural Americans experience significantly poorer clinical outcomes. This trend is rapidly accelerating as rural hospitals close and physician shortages increase, exacerbating health disparities.\n\nIn fact, Americans living in rural communities suffer a mortality rate 23 percent higher than those in urban communities, in part because of the lack of access to quality care.\n\nOur vision is care that enables everyone to achieve their best health. So, we\u2019re creating a new healthcare delivery model that is purpose-built for rural America and directly addresses the issues that have historically limited access and quality. Homeward supports Medicare-eligible beneficiaries by partnering with health plans, providers, and communities to align incentives \u2013 taking full financial accountability for clinical outcomes and the total cost of care across rural counties.\n\nAs a public benefit corporation and Certified B Corp, Homeward\u2019s mission and business model are aligned to address the healthcare, economic, and demographic challenges that make it challenging for rural Americans to stay healthy. Our Homeward Navigation platform uses advanced analytics to connect members to the right care and local resources that address social determinants of health and improve holistic health outcomes.\n\nSince many rural communities lack adequate clinical capacity, Homeward also employs care teams that supplement local practices and reach people who cannot otherwise access care.\n\nHomeward is co-founded by a leadership team that defined and delivered Livongo\u2019s products, and backed most recently by a $50 million series B co-led by Arch Ventures and Human Capital, with participation from General Catalyst for a total of $70 million in funding. With this leadership team and funding, Homeward is committed to bringing high-quality healthcare to rural communities in need.\n\nJoin us in tackling healthcare for rural America! We\u2019re seeking a Senior Software Engineer to be a key contributor to our Engineering team who is passionate about having positive societal impact and using technology for good - solving issues of health inequity for communities that have been perennially underserved.
